I have created this PacMan game project in an attempt to learn Cocos2D.  It is a prototype from which you may derive your own game.

This code is free to be used for your personnal projects.  This code base CANNOT BE SOLD unmodified or modified in parts or as a whole.  Reselling the code is not permitted in any form.

Please contact me if you want to use this code base for commerical products.
